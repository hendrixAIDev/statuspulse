# StatusPulse UX Review — Feb 1, 2026

## Summary
Review of app.py dashboard UX covering onboarding, empty states, value proposition clarity, and mobile readiness.

---

## 1. Onboarding for New Users

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ (Decent)**

**What works:**
- Login/Signup page has a clean centered layout with clear tabs
- Free tier info shown at the bottom: "Free tier: 3 monitors • 5-min checks • Email alerts"
- Signup form validates password match and minimum length

**What's missing:**
- No guided tour or first-time tooltip explaining what StatusPulse does in detail
- No "how it works" section (add URL → we check it → you get alerts)
- No example/demo that lets users see the product before signing up
- After signup, user lands on empty dashboard with no quick-start prompt (just sidebar form)

**Recommendations:**
- Add a brief "How It Works" section on the auth page (3 steps: Add URL → We Monitor → Get Alerts)
- After first login, show a prominent inline "Add your first monitor" card in the main content area, not just the sidebar
- Consider a pre-built demo monitor (e.g., monitoring httpbin.org) auto-added on first signup

## 2. Empty State

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ (Adequate)**

**What works:**
- Empty state shows a centered welcome message: "👋 Welcome to StatusPulse!"
- Points users to the sidebar: "Add your first monitor using the sidebar"
- Repeats free tier limits

**What's missing:**
- The call-to-action points to the sidebar, but on mobile the sidebar is collapsed by default — users may not find it
- No visual illustration or animation to make the empty state engaging
- No sample/example URLs to try

**Recommendations:**
- Add an inline "Add Monitor" form directly in the empty state content area (in addition to sidebar)
- Suggest example URLs: "Try monitoring https://httpbin.org/status/200"
- Add a subtle animation or illustration to make the empty state feel polished

## 3. Value Proposition Clarity

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Good)**

**What works:**
- Tagline is clear: "Simple uptime monitoring for developers"
- Free tier details visible on login page
- Page title includes "Uptime Monitoring"

**What's missing:**
- No feature bullets on the login page (e.g., email alerts, public status pages, incident tracking)
- No competitive differentiator mentioned (e.g., "free forever for 3 monitors")
- No screenshots or preview of what the dashboard looks like

**Recommendations:**
- Add 3-4 feature bullets below the tagline on the auth page
- Add a "What you get" section: real-time dashboard, email alerts, public status page, incident history
- Consider a small hero screenshot or mock of the dashboard

---

## 4. Mobile Friendliness

**Rating: ⭐⭐ (Needs Work)**

**What works:**
- Streamlit's `layout="wide"` is responsive by default
- Auth page uses `st.columns([1, 2, 1])` centering which works on mobile
- CSS uses relative units and flexbox

**Issues found:**
- Sidebar-dependent UX: "Add Monitor" is ONLY in the sidebar. On mobile, sidebar starts collapsed — new users won't know to open it
- Dashboard metrics use `st.columns(4)` — on narrow screens, 4 columns get very cramped
- Monitor cards with `st.columns([2, 1, 1, 1])` will squish on mobile
- Uptime bar CSS uses `min-width: 2px` segments — works but very small on mobile
- Response time charts (Plotly) are responsive but can be hard to interact with on touch

**Recommendations:**
- Add inline "Add Monitor" form in main content area (not just sidebar)
- Use `st.columns(2)` for metrics on mobile (detect with JS or just use 2 columns always)
- Consider a single-column layout for monitor details on narrow screens
- Test with actual mobile viewport and adjust CSS breakpoints

## 5. Other UX Observations

### Dashboard Header
- The "📡 StatusPulse" header is rendered as raw HTML div — works but could use the user's name for personalization ("Welcome back, user@email.com")

### Monitor Management
- **Delete has no confirmation** — clicking "🗑️ Delete" immediately deletes with no undo. Should add a confirmation step or at least `st.warning` before delete
- "Check Now" button works well — gives immediate feedback
- Pause/Resume toggle is intuitive

### Data Loading
- Every monitor calculates uptime with a separate Supabase query (`get_uptime_percentage`) — with many monitors, the dashboard will be slow. Consider batch-loading or caching
- The 7-Day Uptime metric in the summary bar calls `get_uptime_percentage` for every non-unknown monitor — could be expensive

### Public Status Page (in app.py)
- The `page_status` function in app.py is separate from `public_status.py` — two implementations of the same feature. Consider consolidating

## Priority Fixes

1. **🔴 Delete confirmation** — Add confirmation before deleting a monitor
2. **🟡 Mobile "Add Monitor"** — Add inline form in empty state + main content area
3. **🟡 Onboarding flow** — Add "How It Works" steps on auth page
4. **🟢 Performance** — Cache/batch uptime percentage queries
5. **🟢 Feature bullets** — Add value props to login page
